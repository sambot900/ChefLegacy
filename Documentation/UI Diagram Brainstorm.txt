New User Screen:
-After name and avatar are selected and player selects confirmation button,
 the screen fades to white, and then fades back to a title screen.
-Music starts and storyboard images are displayed. Storyboard is progressed
 with user click input. Input is only accepted to skip after the images
 has fully rendered and is not fading in or experiencing a transition.
-When storyboard is elapsed, our controller moves to level zero.

Level Zero:
-Level zero starts by viewing the restraunt with the player avatar visible
 in the kitchen. The user is only able to click the round start button
 which is being highlighted in some way. (guided tutorial action)
 Instructions are present on the screen to select round start.
-User selects the round start. Relevant round start audio and animation.
-Customer immediately approaches the counter. There is no game clock in
 round zero. The customer orders a simple burger.
-User is instructed to pick up a raw beef patty. Once complete,
 the user is instructed to click the stove, where the patty is placed.
 The patty is cooked, and the user is instructed to click the stove again
 to remove the patty from the burner. The avatar now holds the cooked patty.
-The user is instructed to click on a bin of hamburger buns. The avatar
 navigates to the bin and an assembled burger appears in the avatar's
 hand.
-Through a few more customers, level zero shows the user how to serve
 drinks and sides as well.
-With the final customer served, a "round win" animation occurs and the user
 is brought to a round summary score screen. This screen includes:
	1. money made
	1b. bonus money from multiplier
		*Rounds can have one of many multipliers, or no multipliers.
	2. number of customers served
	3. combos performed
	4. power-ups used
-The user advances past the summary score screen by clicking continue.
-A visual transition brings us back to the restraunt. We lock the user into
 exploring new equipment. We force them to buy an upgrade to their drinks
 dispenser. (User is forced to select expedited shipping for extra charge)
-The tutorial ceases after the drink dispenser is purchased and the user is
 free to browse upgrades
